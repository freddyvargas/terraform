# Terraform Certification Scenario: Questions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9

This scenario demonstrates key Terraform concepts from the Certification 004. It uses the `azurerm` backend from the `backend-state-bootstrap` folder with the backend key: `exercises-questions-terraform-004portal.tfstate`

## Question No. 2

**Question:** You want to create a string that combines a generated random_id and a variable and reuse that string several times in your configuration. What is the simplest correct way to implement this without repeating the random_id and variable?

**Options:**
- A) Use a module.
- B) Add an output value.
- C) Add a local value.
- D) Use a data source.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The simplest and most efficient way to assign a name to an expression for reusing it multiple times within the same module is by using local values (locals). Locals function as constants or temporary variables within the configuration, allowing you to combine values from different sources (such as a random_id resource and an input variable) in a single centralized expression. This improves readability and avoids code duplication, making maintenance easier if the logic of that text string changes in the future.

**Explanation:**

Option A is incorrect: Although modules allow the reuse of complete configurations, using them just to combine two simple values within the same file would result in unnecessary and complex over-engineering for the stated objective.

Option B is incorrect: An output value is used to expose information from a module to the outside (to the user or to other modules), not to perform internal calculations or string combinations meant to be reused within the same configuration block.

Option D is incorrect: A data source is used to query information from infrastructures external to Terraform or already existing resources. It is not a mechanism for performing text string manipulations or internal variable logic.

## Question No. 3

**Question:** Which task does terraform init not perform?

**Options:**
- A) Discovers all providers used in the configuration and downloads them.
- B) Validates that values are set for all required input variables.
- C) Connects to the configured backend.
- D) Discovers any remote modules and downloads them.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The terraform init command is used exclusively to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. Its main function is environment preparation, which includes downloading plugins (plugins) and configuring the backend. However, it does not perform validations on input variable values; this validation and verification process that all required variables have an assigned value occurs during the terraform plan or terraform apply stages.

**Explanation:**

Option A is incorrect: This is one of the main tasks of terraform init. The command scans the configuration, identifies the necessary providers (such as AWS, Azure, GCP) and downloads the corresponding binaries to the local .terraform directory.

Option C is incorrect: terraform init is the command responsible for initializing the backend configured in the terraform block. This includes establishing the connection and, if necessary, migrating existing state to the new backend.

Option D is incorrect: During initialization, Terraform searches for any remote modules referenced in the configuration and downloads the source code of those modules to the local directory so they can be used in the deployment.

## Question No. 4

**Question:** What functionality do providers offer in Terraform? (Pick the 3 correct responses below.)

**Options:**
- A) Group a collection of Terraform configuration files that map to a single state file.
- B) Provision resources for on-premises infrastructure services.
- C) Provision resources for public cloud infrastructure services.
- D) Interact with cloud provider APIs.
- E) Enforce security and compliance policies.

**Correct Answer:** B, C, D

**Explanation:** Providers are the foundation of Terraform's extensibility. Their main function is to serve as an abstraction layer that translates HCL code into calls to specific APIs (Option D). Thanks to this plugin architecture, Terraform can manage a vast variety of services, including both public clouds such as AWS, Google Cloud or Azure (Option C), as well as on-premises or local infrastructures such as VMware, OpenStack or Kubernetes (Option B).

**Explanation:**

Option A is incorrect: Grouping a collection of configuration files that map to a state file is the definition of a module (specifically the root module), not a provider.

Option E is incorrect: Although Terraform interacts with security services, the function of enforcing security and compliance policies is the responsibility of Policy as Code tools, such as Sentinel (in HCP Terraform/Enterprise) or OPA (Open Policy Agent), and not of the infrastructure providers themselves.

## Question No. 5

**Question:** Exhibit:
```
module "network" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
}
```
What version of the source module does Terraform allow with the module block shown in the exhibit?

**Options:**
- A) Any version of the module > 11.0.
- B) Any version of the module >= 11.0.
- C) Any version of the module >= 11.0 and < 12.0.
- D) Any version of the module >= 11.0.0 and < 11.1.0.

**Correct Answer:** The latest available version (none of the provided options are strictly correct for the exhibit as shown).

**Explanation:** According to the official Terraform documentation, when using a module from a registry (such as the Terraform Registry) and omitting the version argument, Terraform will automatically download the latest available version at the time terraform init is run. In the exhibit shown, the module block only contains the source argument and lacks a version constraint, so it is not limited to a specific range as mentioned in the options (unless the latest version happens to coincide with one of them).

**Explanation:**

Option A is incorrect: This answer would correspond to a configuration that explicitly includes version = "> 11.0". Without this line in the code, Terraform does not apply this specific constraint.

Option B is incorrect: This answer would require the configuration version = ">= 11.0". Although often associated with "any version" in practice exams if 11.0 is assumed as the base, technically Terraform without constraints seeks the absolute latest version, not just those above 11.0.

Option C is incorrect: This range represents the behavior of the pessimistic operator ~> 11.0. If the exhibit had version = "~> 11.0", Terraform would allow incremental updates within major version 11 (minor updates), but not version 12.0 or higher.

Option D is incorrect: This range represents the behavior of the ~> 11.0.0 operator. It would only allow patches within version 11.0 (patch updates), blocking any changes in the minor version (such as 11.1.0).

Note: In many certification exams, this question usually includes an additional line like version = "11.0" or similar in the exhibit. The standard behavior is to download the latest available version.

## Question No. 6

**Question:** What's the proper syntax for the plan command?

**Options:**
- A) terraform apply -var-file=tfplan
- B) terraform plan -target=tfplan
- C) terraform plan -generate-config-out=tfplan
- D) terraform plan -out=tfplan

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:** The correct syntax for saving an execution plan to a file is using the -out=path option with the terraform plan command. According to the official documentation, this allows saving the generated plan deterministically so that it can later be executed exactly the same way using terraform apply <PATH>, ensuring no changes occur between the planning and application phases.

**Explanation:**

Option A is incorrect: The terraform apply command is used to apply changes, and the -var-file flag is used to load variable values from an external file (usually .tfvars), not to manage plan files.

Option B is incorrect: The -target flag is used to limit Terraform's operation to a specific resource or module and its dependencies, not to define an output file for the plan.

Option C is incorrect: Although -generate-config-out is a valid option introduced in recent versions for automatic configuration (HCL) generation during import processes, it is not the standard syntax or general purpose for saving an infrastructure execution plan.

## Question No. 7

**Question:** Exhibit:

```
Error: Saved plan is stale

The given plan file can no longer be applied because the state was changed by another operation after the plan was created.
```

You have a saved execution plan containing desired changes for infrastructure managed by Terraform. After running terraform apply my.tfplan, you receive the error shown. How can you apply the desired changes? (Pick the 2 correct responses below.)

**Options:**
- A) Generate a new execution plan file with terraform plan, and apply the new plan.
- B) Run terraform apply without the saved execution plan.
- C) Force the apply command by adding the flag -lock=false.
- D) Refresh the current state data using the -refresh-only flag.
- E) Update the current plan file using the terraform state push command.

**Correct Answer:** A, B

**Explanation:** The "Saved plan is stale" error occurs because Terraform detects that the state file (terraform.tfstate) has been modified (either by another execution, a manual change, or a team process) after the plan file (.tfplan) was generated. Terraform uses a serial number in the state to ensure that changes are not applied based on outdated information. The technical solution is to discard the old plan and generate a new one based on the current infrastructure state, which is achieved by generating a new plan file (Option A) or running the apply command directly so that Terraform performs the refresh and planning cycle at the moment (Option B).

**Explanation:**

Option C is incorrect: The -lock=false flag is used to skip state locking when it is suspected that a previous lock was not released correctly, but it does not solve the version discrepancy between a saved plan and the current state.

Option D is incorrect: Although -refresh-only updates the state with the reality of the infrastructure, it does not "fix" an already created plan file; the original plan will remain invalid because it was calculated on a state version that is no longer the latest.

Option E is incorrect: The terraform state push command is used for manual state management (such as migrations or disaster recovery), it has no functionality to update or modify binary execution plan files.

## Question No. 8

**Question:** Which are benefits of migrating from a local state backend to a remote backend? (Pick the 2 correct responses below.)

**Options:**
- A) Guarantees that configuration drift cannot occur for the managed infrastructure.
- B) Eliminates the need to manage credentials when deploying infrastructure to multiple cloud providers.
- C) Faster plan and apply execution because the state is cached locally on the cloud provider.
- D) State locking that allows multiple team members to safely work on the same infrastructure.
- E) The ability to enable server-side encryption at rest.

**Correct Answer:** D, E

**Explanation:** Migrating to a remote backend offers critical advantages for security and collaborative work. First, state locking (Option D) is essential in team environments, as it prevents two people from running Terraform at the same time, which could corrupt the state file. Second, remote backends (such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HCP Terraform) allow the use of encryption at rest (Option E), protecting sensitive information that Terraform usually stores in plain text within the state file, such as passwords or access keys.

**Explanation:**

Option A is incorrect: The state file only records the last known configuration; it cannot "guarantee" that drift (deviation) cannot occur, as manual changes in the cloud console can happen regardless of the backend used.

Option B is incorrect: Although a remote backend manages the state, the user still needs to configure and manage provider credentials (such as AWS or Azure) to be able to create or modify actual resources on those platforms.

Option C is incorrect: Generally, a remote backend is slower than a local one, as it requires network calls to download and upload the state file in each operation, unlike instant access to a file on local disk.

## Question No. 9

**Question:** Which command generates DOT (Document Template) formatted data to visualize Terraform dependencies?

**Options:**
- A) terraform graph
- B) terraform show
- C) terraform refresh
- D) terraform output

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:** The terraform graph command is used to generate a visual representation of the Terraform configuration or an execution plan. According to the official documentation, this command produces output in the DOT graph description language, which can be used by tools like Graphviz to generate diagrams. These diagrams are essential for understanding dependencies between resources and the order in which Terraform plans to create or modify them.

**Explanation:**

Option B is incorrect: The terraform show command is used to display a human-readable version of a state file or execution plan. Although it provides detailed information, it does not generate DOT-formatted data or dependency diagrams.

Option C is incorrect: terraform refresh aims to update the local state file with the actual infrastructure found in the cloud. It has no visualization or graph generation functions.

Option D is incorrect: The terraform output command is specifically used to extract and display the values of output variables that have been defined in the configuration, allowing querying specific data from the state without needing to read the entire file.
